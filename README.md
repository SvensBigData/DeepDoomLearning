# DeepDoomLearning

This is an implementation off Deep Reinforcement Learning see: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf.

It is based on the ViZDoom(https://github.com/Marqt/ViZDoom) learning environment. The deep convolutional network is implemented in tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/)

This proof of concept implementation, can serve as a starting point for further investigation. The implemented 2-layer deep network is able to learn the basic scenario from ViZDoom within 1 hours on a GeForce GTX 970.
