My setup used Ubuntu 14.04 

To run the Agent ViZDoom and TensorFlow must be installed.

ViZDoom must be installed with python bindings enabled.
Installation notes can be found here:
https://github.com/Marqt/ViZDoom

Also TensorFlow must be installed it both cpu and gpu can be used.
For training the agent i strongly recommend the gpu version.
Installation note for TensorFlow can be found here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html

node: I used tensorflow 0.8 newest version is 0.9.

Additional to the requiered packages for ViZDoom and TensorFlow I also used OpenCV for Python:
http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
with i had to install seperatly

After everthing is installed the are two python file:
1. deep_doom.py the learning agent
2. deep_doom_player.py the playing agent with is a supclass from deep_doom.py

The easyest way to use this agents is to put them under the ViZDoom folder under examples/python
There are two config files deepdoomplayer.cfg and learningtensorflow.cfg put them under examples/config

There is a additional saved checkpoint folder with have saved network weights for epoch 20,30 to 150.
I put them in my home directory, in der deep_doom.py file there is the varialbe:
checkpoint_path="/home/sven/checkpoint/new/"
with is used for saving by the deep_doom.py and loading for the deep_doom_player.py.
So to load a network set this pfad to one of the saved epoch folders. 
In each of the epoched folder is also a file called "checkpoint"
which should be opened with a text-editor and the value for "model_checkpoint_path" must be change to the used pfad.

node: It is not necessary to change all checkpoint files, only the one which will be used.

To run the files from commandline I then simple used:
~/ViZDoom$ python examples/python/deep_doom.py or
~/ViZDoom$ python examples/python/deep_doom_player.py

You have to be in the ViZDoom home directory.
